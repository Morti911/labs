      The Oldsmobile Cutlass is a line of automobiles that were made by Oldsmobile. The Cutlass began as a unibody compact car, but saw its greatest success as a body-on-frame intermediate car.
      Introduced in 1961 as the top trim level in Olds' compact F-85 line, over the years the Cutlass name accumulated great brand equity, and became one of the most popular nameplates in the industry in the 1970s.[citation needed] By the 1980s, Oldsmobile was using the Cutlass as a sub-marque, with numerous vehicle lines bearing the name simultaneously. These included the Cutlass Calais compact, the midsize Cutlass Ciera, the Cutlass Cruiser station wagon, and the premium midsize Cutlass Supreme.
