      The Plymouth Road Runner is a performance car built by Plymouth in the United States between 1968 and 1980. By 1968, the original muscle cars were moving away from their roots as relatively cheap, fast cars as they gained options. Although Plymouth already had a performance car in the GTX, it wanted to reincarnate the original muscle car concept in a car able to run 14-second quarter mile (402 m) times and sell for less than US$3000. Both goals were met, and the Road Runner would outsell the upscale GTX.

      The 1969 model kept the same basic look but with some slight changes such as tail lights and grille, side marker lights, optional bucket seats, and new Road Runner decals. The Road Runner added a convertible option for 1969 with 2,128 droptop models produced that year. All were 383 engine cars, except for ten which were equipped with a 426 Hemi (six automatic and four 4-speed manual.) Six are known to exist. No 440 6-bbl convertibles were made in 1969.
      An Air Grabber option (N96 code) was introduced this year; it consisted of a fiberglass air duct assembly bolted to the underside of the hood that connected to twin rectangular upward-facing vents in the hood with orange vent screens. The fiberglass hood box had an "Air Grabber" sticker on the front. When the hood was closed, a rubber seal fit over the large-oval unsilenced air cleaner. A decal with Wile E. Coyote saying "Coyote Duster" was on the air cleaner lid.[3] The assembly ducted air directly into the engine. The vents in the hood could be opened and closed via a lever under the dashboard labeled "Carb Air." [2][3]
      In 1969, the 383 engine was the standard powerplant, and the 426 Hemi was the only engine option available for the Road Runner until mid-year production. The 383 was marketed as the "383 Road Runner" engine, which is also what the air cleaner read.
