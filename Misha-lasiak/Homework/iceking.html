    <p>Ice King (real name Simon Petrikov) is a major character conceived, but no longer acting as, the main antagonist of Adventure Time. His typical crime would be to kidnap a princess and force her to marry him, which Finn and Jake would foil every time. As his name suggests, Ice King is also his title, announcing himself as King of Ice; the ruler of the Ice Kingdom.</p>
